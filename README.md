# Checkers with AI in Haskell
This implementation is done as a Semester project for the Haskell course. I have built the board game checkers with terminal-based interface and AI player. You can choose 3 modes: Player vs Player, Player vs Bot and Bot vs Bot just for fun. 

To start the program: 
1) open it in ghci
2) type "main".
